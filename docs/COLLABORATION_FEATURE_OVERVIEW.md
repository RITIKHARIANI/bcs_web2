# Faculty Collaboration Feature - Overview

**Date:** January 2025
**Approved Approach:** Simple Co-Author Model + Activity Tracking
**Timeline:** 3 weeks
**Cost:** $0

---

## What We're Building

A simple collaboration system that allows **multiple faculty members to co-author and co-edit courses and modules** with full transparency through activity tracking.

---

## Key Features

### 1. **Add Collaborators**
- Faculty can invite other faculty members to collaborate on their courses/modules
- Search by name or email
- One-click to add

### 2. **Equal Editing Rights**
- All collaborators have the same permissions:
  - ✅ Edit content
  - ✅ Publish courses
  - ✅ Delete content
  - ✅ Add/remove other collaborators
- **Simple model:** No complex roles or hierarchies

### 3. **Activity Tracking**
- See who made what changes and when
- Activity feed shows:
  - "Prof. Smith updated course title"
  - "Dr. Johnson added a new module"
  - "Prof. Williams published the course"
- Complete transparency and accountability

### 4. **Manage Collaborators**
- View all collaborators on a course/module
- Remove collaborators when needed
- See collaborator activity (last edit, total edits)

## Faculty Workflow

### Scenario: Professor + Teaching Assistants

**Step 1:** Professor creates a course
**Step 2:** Professor adds 2 TAs as collaborators
**Step 3:** All 3 faculty can edit the course
**Step 4:** Activity feed shows who made each change
**Step 5:** Professor publishes when ready

### Scenario: Co-Instructors

**Step 1:** Professor A creates a course
**Step 2:** Professor A adds Professor B as collaborator
**Step 3:** Both professors can edit, publish, and manage content
**Step 4:** Both can see each other's changes in real-time via activity feed

## Timeline

**Week 1:** Database setup + API endpoints
**Week 2:** User interface components

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

If needed later, we can easily add:
- **Role-based permissions** (Owner, Editor, Reviewer, Viewer)
- **Email invitations** (invite via email link)
- **Real-time presence** (see who's currently editing)
- **Comment system** (discuss changes before publishing)

The current architecture is built to support these additions without requiring major changes.

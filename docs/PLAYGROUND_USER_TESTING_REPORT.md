## Issues Found

### Issue #1: Search Hides Featured Templates ❌ CRITICAL
**Severity:** High
**Page:** `/playgrounds`
**Location:** src/app/playgrounds/page.tsx:132

**Problem:**
When a user searches for a playground (e.g., types "neural"), the entire "Featured Templates" section disappears and shows "No playgrounds found". Featured templates should remain visible during search, as they are static resources, not user-generated content.

**Current Behavior:**
```jsx
{activeFilter === 'all' && !searchQuery && (
  <div className="mb-12">
    {/* Featured Templates */}
  </div>
)}
```

**Expected Behavior:**
Featured templates should be filtered by search query but always remain visible, or be in a separate section that's always shown.

**Impact:**
Users searching for templates cannot find the professionally designed templates, defeating the purpose of having featured templates.

**Screenshots:**
- `playground-listing-initial.png` - Normal view with templates
- `playground-listing-search.png` - Search causes templates to disappear

---

### Issue #2: Category Filter Hides Featured Templates ❌ CRITICAL
**Severity:** High
**Page:** `/playgrounds`
**Location:** src/app/playgrounds/page.tsx:132

**Problem:**
When a user clicks a category filter (e.g., "Neural Networks"), the featured templates section completely disappears, even though some templates belong to that category.

**Current Behavior:**
Same conditional logic as Issue #1 - templates only show when `activeFilter === 'all'`

**Expected Behavior:**
Featured templates should filter along with the category selection, showing only templates that match the selected category.

**Impact:**
Users cannot discover featured templates when browsing by category, creating a disjointed user experience.

### Issue #3: Monaco Editor CSP Violations ⚠️ HIGH
**Severity:** High
**Page:** `/playgrounds/builder`
**Location:** next.config.ts:79-94

**Problem:**
Monaco Editor triggers Content Security Policy violations:
1. **Refused to load stylesheet** from `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/monaco-editor@0.54.0/min/vs/editor/editor.main.css`
2. **Refused to create web worker** from blob URLs

**Console Errors:**
```
[ERROR] Refused to load the stylesheet 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/monaco-editor@0.54.0/min/vs/editor/editor.main.css' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com".

[ERROR] Refused to create a worker from 'blob:http://localhost:3001/...' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://www.google-analytics.com https://cdn.jsdelivr.net https://unpkg.com https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com https://va.vercel-scripts.com". Note that 'worker-src' was not explicitly set, so 'script-src' is used as a fallback.

[WARNING] Could not create web worker(s). Falling back to loading web worker code in main thread, which might cause UI freezes.
```

**Root Cause:**
Current CSP headers in next.config.ts:
- Line 83: `style-src` doesn't include `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net`
- No `worker-src` directive allowing `blob:` URLs for Monaco web workers

**Impact:**
- Editor functionality degraded (no web workers = potential UI freezes)
- Performance issues when editing large code files
- Console spam with errors

**Screenshot:**
- `playground-builder-step2-editor.png` - Editor loads but with CSP warnings

### Issue #4: Preview Shows Wrong Code ❌ CRITICAL
**Severity:** Critical
**Page:** `/playgrounds/builder` (Step 3: Preview)
**Location:** src/components/playground/ShinyliveEmbed.tsx

**Problem:**
When previewing a playground after selecting the "Neural Network Playground" template, the Shinylive iframe displays a basic template (simple slider example) instead of the loaded Neural Network code.

**Expected Behavior:**
The preview should display the exact code that's loaded in the Monaco editor (221 lines of Neural Network code).

**Actual Behavior:**
Preview shows this basic template:
```python
from shiny import App, render, ui

app_ui = ui.page_fluid(
    ui.input_slider("n", "N", 0, 100, 20),
    ui.output_text_verbatim("txt"),
)

def server(input, output, session):
    @render.text
    def txt():
        return f"n*2 is {input.n() * 2}"

app = App(app_ui, server)
```

**Root Cause:**
Possible issues:
1. The `code` state is not being passed correctly to `ShinyliveEmbed`
2. The base64 encoding in ShinyliveEmbed is failing
3. Shinylive URL encoding is incorrect
4. Browser caching of the Shinylive iframe

**Impact:**
CRITICAL - Users cannot verify their code works before saving. This breaks the entire preview workflow.

**Screenshot:**
- `playground-builder-step3-preview.png` - Shows basic template instead of Neural Network code

### Issue #5: Save Fails with 401 Unauthorized ❌ CRITICAL
**Severity:** Critical
**Page:** `/playgrounds/builder` (Step 3: Preview)
**API:** `POST /api/playgrounds`

**Problem:**
When clicking "Save & Publish", the request fails with a 401 Unauthorized error.

**Server Log:**
```
POST /api/playgrounds 401 in 260ms
```

**Browser Alert:**
`Failed to save playground. Please try again.`

**Root Cause:**
The API endpoint requires authentication, but the user is not logged in. The builder allows unauthenticated users to create playgrounds but fails at save time.

**Impact:**
CRITICAL - Users can spend 10-30 minutes creating a playground only to discover they need to log in. All work may be lost.

---

### Issue #6: No Authentication Check Upfront ⚠️ HIGH
**Severity:** High
**Page:** `/playgrounds/builder`
**Location:** src/app/playgrounds/builder/page.tsx

**Problem:**
The playground builder doesn't check authentication status upfront. Users can:
1. Browse templates
2. Edit code
3. Preview
4. Only fail when clicking "Save & Publish"

**Expected Behavior:**
One of these approaches:
1. **Option A (Recommended):** Show a login prompt/banner when user clicks "Create Playground" if not authenticated
2. **Option B:** Allow anonymous creation but store in localStorage and prompt to sign up before saving
3. **Option C:** Redirect to login before accessing builder

**Impact:**
Poor user experience - users invest time only to hit an authentication wall. No indication that login is required until the final step.

**Related:** Issue #5

---

### Issue #7: Mobile Editor Usability ⚠️ MEDIUM
**Severity:** Medium
**Page:** `/playgrounds/builder` (Mobile)
**Viewport:** 375x667 (iPhone SE)

**Problem:**
While the editor is technically responsive, editing code on mobile is challenging:
1. Monaco Editor line numbers and code are very small
2. No mobile-optimized controls (e.g., toolbar for common actions)
3. Syntax highlighting colors may be hard to read on small screens
4. No "full screen" mode for editing

**Current Behavior:**
- Editor renders at full width
- Text appears very small
- Tap targets for buttons are acceptable but code editing is difficult

**Impact:**
Medium - Most users won't create playgrounds on mobile, but the experience should be better for those who try.

**Screenshot:**

---

## 🚀 Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Resend Account

1. Go to **https://resend.com**
2. Click **"Sign Up"** (it's free!)
3. Sign up with your email or GitHub account
4. Verify your email address

---

### Step 2: Get Your API Key

1. Once logged in, go to **"API Keys"** in the sidebar
2. Click **"Create API Key"**
3. Give it a name: `BCS E-Textbook Development`
4. Select permission: **"Full Access"** or **"Sending Access"**
5. Click **"Create"**
6. **Copy the API key** (it will look like: `re_123abc456def...`)
   - ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Save this key now! You won't be able to see it again.

---

### Step 3: Add Domain (For Production)

For development, you can skip this and use Resend's test domain. For production:

1. Go to **"Domains"** in Resend dashboard
2. Click **"Add Domain"**
3. Enter your domain (e.g., `bcs-etextbook.com`)
4. Follow DNS setup instructions (add SPF, DKIM records)
5. Wait for verification (usually 5-10 minutes)

**For Development**: Resend provides `onboarding@resend.dev` that you can use immediately!

---

### Step 4: Update Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Email Configuration (Resend)
EMAIL_PROVIDER="resend"
RESEND_API_KEY="re_your_api_key_here"
EMAIL_FROM="onboarding@resend.dev"  # Use this for development
EMAIL_FROM_NAME="BCS E-Textbook"
```

**For Production** (add to Vercel Environment Variables):
```bash
EMAIL_PROVIDER="resend"
RESEND_API_KEY="re_your_production_api_key"
EMAIL_FROM="noreply@your-domain.com"  # Use your verified domain
EMAIL_FROM_NAME="BCS E-Textbook"
```

---

### Step 5: Restart Your Dev Server

```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

## 🔍 Monitoring & Debugging

### View Sent Emails

1. Go to Resend dashboard

   - ✅ Delivered
   - 📬 Queued
   - ❌ Bounced
   - 🚫 Rejected

### Check Email Logs

Click on any email to see:
- Delivery status
- Open/click tracking
- Headers
- Full email content

### Common Issues

**1. Email not received?**
- Check spam/junk folder
- Verify `EMAIL_FROM` address is correct
- Check Resend dashboard for bounce/rejection
- Make sure API key is correct

**2. "Domain not verified" error?**
- For development: Use `onboarding@resend.dev`

**3. "Rate limit exceeded"?**
- Free tier: 100 emails/day

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit API keys** to git
   - ✅ API keys should only be in `.env` (which is gitignored)
   - ✅ For production, set in Vercel environment variables

2. **Use different API keys** for development and production
   - Development key: Has broader permissions for testing
   - Production key: Restricted to sending only

3. **Rotate keys regularly**
   - Create new API key every 3-6 months
   - Delete old keys after rotation

---

## 🚀 Production Deployment (Vercel)

### Add Environment Variables to Vercel

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings → Environment Variables**
3. Add the following for **Production**:

```
EMAIL_PROVIDER = resend
RESEND_API_KEY = re_your_production_api_key
EMAIL_FROM = noreply@your-domain.com
EMAIL_FROM_NAME = BCS E-Textbook
```

4. Click **"Save"**
5. Redeploy your application

# Complete AI Prompting Sequence

## üéØ **STEP-BY-STEP PROMPTS FOR BUILDING THE E-TEXTBOOK PLATFORM**

Follow these prompts in exact order to build your e-textbook platform:

---

## üìã **PROMPT 1: PROJECT VALIDATION (BEFORE ANY CODING)**

**Copy-paste this first:**

```
I want you to build an e-textbook platform for a university Brain and Cognitive Sciences department. Before you start coding, I need you to provide:

1. ARCHITECTURE PLAN: Technology stack, database schema, project structure, and media handling approach

2. WORKFLOW DESCRIPTION: Detailed step-by-step process for:
   - Faculty creating standalone modules with media content (images, videos, documents)
   - Faculty creating courses by selecting existing modules  
   - Public users accessing and viewing course content with media

3. DATABASE DESIGN: Show me the exact table structure that supports:
   - Independent module creation
   - Module reusability across multiple courses
   - Media file storage and references
   - Faculty authentication

4. KEY DECISIONS: Explain your choices for:
   - Web framework and why
   - Database and why  
   - File storage approach
   - How module-course relationships work

Read these documents for context:
- Educational_Platform_Requirements.md
- Phase_1_Scope.md  
- Development_Guide.md

Only after I approve this plan should you start writing code.
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Review the AI's response carefully. Make sure it includes module reusability, media support, and proper database relationships. Don't proceed until you're satisfied with the architecture plan.**

---

## üöÄ **PROMPT 2: START DEVELOPMENT - AUTHENTICATION**

**After approving the architecture plan:**

```
Perfect! Your architecture plan looks good. Now start building the platform.

Build Task 1 (Faculty Authentication) from Tasks/Task_01_Authentication.md.

Key requirements:
- Faculty-only authentication (no student login needed yet)
- Secure registration and login
- Password reset functionality
- Structure the code to easily add student features later

Set up the complete project structure and build a working authentication system.
```

---

## üîß **PROMPT 3: MODULE CREATION SYSTEM**

**After authentication is working:**

```
Great! The authentication system is working. Now build Task 2 (Module Creation & Course Assembly) from Tasks/Task_02_Course_Creation.md.

Key requirements:
- Faculty can create standalone modules (independent of courses)
- Rich media support: images, videos, documents in modules
- Hierarchical modules (modules can have submodules)
- Module library/management interface
- Faculty can then create courses by selecting existing modules
- Same module can be used in multiple courses

Integrate this with the existing authentication system.
```

---

## üìö **PROMPT 4: HIERARCHICAL MODULE SYSTEM**

**After basic module creation works:**

```
The module creation is working well. Now enhance it with Task 3 (Hierarchical Module System) from Tasks/Task_03_Module_System.md.

Focus on:
- Unlimited nesting levels for modules (1.1.1.1.1...)
- Automatic numbering system
- Drag-and-drop reordering of modules
- Visual hierarchy display (tree view)
- Ensure modules can still be reused across multiple courses

Make sure the hierarchical system integrates smoothly with the existing module creation.
```

---

## üåê **PROMPT 5: PUBLIC COURSE CATALOG**

**After module hierarchy is complete:**

```
Excellent progress! Now build Task 4 (Public Course Catalog) from Tasks/Task_04_Student_Enrollment.md.

Key requirements:
- Public course catalog (no authentication required)
- Anyone can browse and access published courses
- Course search and filtering
- Course details page showing module structure
- All course content publicly accessible
- SEO-friendly URLs

This should integrate with the existing course and module system.
```

---

## üìñ **PROMPT 6: PUBLIC LEARNING INTERFACE**

**After course catalog is working:**

```
The public course catalog looks great! Now build Task 5 (Public Learning Interface) from Tasks/Task_05_Student_Interface.md.

Focus on:
- Excellent reading experience for course content
- Navigation through module hierarchy
- Breadcrumb navigation
- Next/previous module navigation
- Course outline/table of contents
- All media content (images, videos, documents) displays properly
- Mobile-responsive design
- Shareable URLs for specific modules

This completes the core e-textbook functionality.
```

---

## üï∏Ô∏è **PROMPT 7: INTERACTIVE GRAPH VISUALIZATION**

**After the learning interface is complete:**

```
Excellent! The learning interface is working perfectly. Now add a key feature - interactive graph visualization of the course and module structure.

Build an interactive graph/network visualization that shows:

COURSE GRAPH VIEW:
- Visual representation of course structure as an interactive graph
- Nodes represent modules and submodules
- Edges show relationships and hierarchy
- Clickable nodes that navigate to specific modules
- Different node colors/shapes for different module types
- Zoom and pan functionality for large course structures

MODULE RELATIONSHIP VIEW:
- Show how modules are connected across different courses
- Highlight module reusability (same module used in multiple courses)
- Interactive exploration of module dependencies
- Visual indicators for module completion status (for future student features)

FACULTY COURSE DESIGN VIEW:
- Graph-based course structure editor for faculty
- Drag-and-drop modules to reorganize course flow
- Visual course planning and structure overview
- Export/share course structure visualizations

Technical requirements:
- Use a modern graph visualization library (D3.js, Cytoscape.js, or similar)
- Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
- Smooth animations and interactions
- Integration with existing course and module data
- Performance optimization for large course structures

This should enhance both the faculty course creation experience and the public course navigation experience.
```

---

## üé® **PROMPT 8: POLISH AND TESTING**

**After the graph visualization is complete:**

```
Fantastic! The core platform is working. Now let's polish and test everything:

1. TESTING: Create comprehensive test scenarios:
   - Faculty creates modules with images and videos
   - Faculty creates a course using existing modules
   - Public user browses and reads course content
   - Same module used in multiple courses works correctly

2. UI/UX IMPROVEMENTS:
   - Ensure responsive design on all devices
   - Optimize loading times for media content
   - Improve navigation and user experience
   - Add helpful error messages and loading states

3. DOCUMENTATION: Provide:
   - Setup and deployment instructions
   - User guide for faculty
   - Technical documentation for future development

Test everything thoroughly and fix any issues.
```

---

## üöÄ **PROMPT 9: DEPLOYMENT PREPARATION**

**After testing and polish:**

```
Everything is working perfectly! Now prepare for deployment:

1. PRODUCTION SETUP:
   - Configure for production environment
   - Set up proper environment variables
   - Optimize for performance and security
   - Configure media file storage for production

2. DEPLOYMENT GUIDE:
   - Provide step-by-step deployment instructions
   - Include database setup instructions
   - Configure domain and SSL
   - Set up backup procedures

3. FINAL TESTING:
   - Test on production environment
   - Verify all media uploads work
   - Test course creation and public access
   - Ensure everything is secure and performant

Provide complete deployment documentation.
```

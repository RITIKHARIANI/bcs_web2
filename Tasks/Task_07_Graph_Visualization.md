# Task 7: Interactive Graph Visualization

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Build interactive graph visualizations that show course structure, module relationships, and enable visual course design for faculty.

## ðŸ“‹ Requirements
- [ ] Interactive course structure visualization (nodes and edges)
- [ ] Module relationship mapping across different courses
- [ ] Faculty course design interface using graph visualization
- [ ] Clickable nodes for navigation to specific modules
- [ ] Visual indicators for module types and status
- [ ] Zoom, pan, and navigation controls
- [ ] Export/share functionality for course structure diagrams
- [ ] Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## ðŸ‘¤ User Stories
- As a Faculty member, I want to see a visual representation of my course structure
- As a Faculty member, I want to design courses using a graph-based interface
- As a Faculty member, I want to see how modules are connected across different courses
- As a Faculty member, I want to drag and drop modules to reorganize course flow
- As a Public User, I want to see a visual course map to understand the learning path
- As a Public User, I want to click on visual elements to navigate through content
- As a System Administrator, I want to visualize module reusability patterns

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Course structure displays as an interactive graph with modules as nodes
- [ ] Different node types/colors represent different module categories
- [ ] Edges show hierarchical relationships and prerequisites
- [ ] Clicking nodes navigates to corresponding module content
- [ ] Faculty can use graph interface to reorganize course structure
- [ ] Module reusability is visually apparent (same module in multiple courses)
- [ ] Graph supports zoom, pan, and reset view functionality
- [ ] Performance remains smooth with large course structures (100+ modules)
- [ ] Mobile users can interact with graph effectively
- [ ] Graph integrates seamlessly with existing course navigation

## ðŸ”§ Technical Notes
- Use modern graph visualization library (D3.js, Cytoscape.js, Vis.js, or React Flow)
- Implement efficient data structure for large graphs
- Consider force-directed layout for automatic node positioning
- Implement lazy loading for very large course structures
- Cache graph layouts to improve performance
- Ensure graph data stays synchronized with course/module changes
- Consider implementing different view modes (hierarchical, circular, network)
- Add keyboard navigation support for accessibility

## âœ¨ Definition of Done
- [ ] Interactive graph displays course structure correctly
- [ ] Faculty can use graph for visual course design and reorganization
- [ ] Public users can navigate courses using graph interface
- [ ] Module relationships across courses are clearly visualized
- [ ] Graph performance is acceptable with realistic data sizes
- [ ] Mobile and desktop experiences are both excellent
- [ ] Graph integrates properly with existing course/module system
- [ ] Export functionality allows sharing of course structure diagrams

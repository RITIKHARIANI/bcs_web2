# Task 1: Faculty Authentication System

## 🎯 Objective
Build a secure authentication system for Faculty members only to access course creation and management features.

## 📝 Future Considerations
This authentication system is designed to easily expand to include Student roles and enrollment features in future phases. The database and code structure should support adding Student authentication, course enrollment, and progress tracking later without major refactoring.

## 📋 Requirements
- [ ] Faculty registration with email/password
- [ ] Faculty login with session management
- [ ] Secure logout functionality
- [ ] Password reset capability for Faculty
- [ ] Input validation and error handling
- [ ] Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- [ ] Database structure ready for future Student role addition

## 👤 User Stories
- As a Faculty member, I want to register and login so that I can create and manage courses
- As a Faculty member, I want to reset my password if I forget it
- As a Faculty member, I want to stay logged in between sessions until I explicitly log out
- As a System Administrator, I want the authentication system to be ready for future Student role integration

## 🔮 Future User Stories (Not implemented yet)
- As a Student, I want to access courses without needing to login (public access)
- As a Student, I want to register for progress tracking in future phases
- As a Student, I want to enroll in specific courses when enrollment features are added

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Faculty registration form validates email format and password strength
- [ ] Faculty login redirects to course management dashboard
- [ ] Faculty sessions persist across browser sessions until logout
- [ ] Password reset sends email with secure reset link to Faculty
- [ ] All forms show appropriate error messages for invalid inputs
- [ ] Pages are fully responsive on mobile devices
- [ ] Database includes user role field (set to 'faculty' for now, ready for 'student' later)
- [ ] Course content is publicly viewable without authentication (for current e-textbook approach)

## 🔧 Technical Notes
- Design database with user roles field for future expansion (faculty/student/admin)
- Implement proper password hashing (bcrypt or similar)
- Use secure session management (JWT tokens or similar)
- Consider rate limiting for login attempts
- Ensure HTTPS in production
- Create public routes for course content viewing (no authentication required)
- Structure code to easily add Student authentication in future phases
- Consider using authentication service that supports multiple user types

## ✨ Definition of Done
- [ ] Faculty can register, login, and access faculty dashboard
- [ ] Password reset flow works end-to-end for Faculty
- [ ] All forms include proper validation and error handling
- [ ] Code includes basic security best practices
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile and desktop
- [ ] Course content is publicly accessible without login
- [ ] Authentication system is structured for easy Student role addition in future

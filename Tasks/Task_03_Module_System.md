# Task 3: Hierarchical Module System

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Build a flexible module creation system that supports unlimited nesting levels (1, 1.1, 1.1.1, etc.) within courses.

## ðŸ“‹ Requirements
- [ ] Module creation interface within courses
- [ ] Support for unlimited nesting levels (1.1.1.1.1...)
- [ ] Automatic numbering system for modules
- [ ] Drag-and-drop module reordering
- [ ] Module editing and deletion
- [ ] Rich text content editor for modules
- [ ] Module status management (draft/published)
- [ ] Visual hierarchy display (tree view)

## ðŸ‘¤ User Stories
- As a Faculty member, I want to create modules within my courses
- As a Faculty member, I want to create sub-modules under existing modules
- As a Faculty member, I want modules to be automatically numbered (1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.1.1, etc.)
- As a Faculty member, I want to reorder modules by dragging and dropping
- As a Faculty member, I want to write rich content for each module
- As a Faculty member, I want to see the module hierarchy in a clear tree structure
- As a Faculty member, I want to save module drafts before publishing

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Faculty can create top-level modules (1, 2, 3...)
- [ ] Faculty can create sub-modules under any existing module (1.1, 1.2, 1.1.1...)
- [ ] Module numbering updates automatically when modules are reordered
- [ ] Drag-and-drop reordering works for modules at any level
- [ ] Rich text editor supports formatting, links, and basic styling
- [ ] Module tree view clearly shows hierarchy and numbering
- [ ] Modules can be saved as drafts or published
- [ ] Module deletion removes all sub-modules with confirmation
- [ ] Module content is preserved when moving modules around

## ðŸ”§ Technical Notes
- Use a tree data structure or materialized path for hierarchy
- Implement efficient renumbering algorithm when modules are moved
- Consider using a library for drag-and-drop functionality
- Store module content in a format that supports rich text (HTML/Markdown)
- Ensure database relationships handle parent-child module connections
- Implement recursive deletion for modules with children
- Consider caching for module tree queries on large courses

## âœ¨ Definition of Done
- [ ] Faculty can create modules and sub-modules at any level
- [ ] Automatic numbering system works correctly
- [ ] Drag-and-drop reordering functions smoothly
- [ ] Rich text editor allows proper content creation
- [ ] Module hierarchy is clearly visualized
- [ ] Module draft/published status works correctly
- [ ] Module deletion handles sub-modules appropriately
- [ ] Performance is acceptable with deeply nested modules

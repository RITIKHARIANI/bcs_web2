# What to Give an AI Model for Development

## 🎯 **COPY-PASTE INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI**

When you're ready to start development, provide this exact text to your AI model:

---

## 🎯 **EXACT PROMPT FOR FRESH PROJECT**

Copy and paste this exact text to your AI model:

---

**"I want you to build an e-textbook platform for a university Brain and Cognitive Sciences department. Here are the project documents that define what needs to be built:**

**READ THESE FIRST:**
1. Educational_Platform_Requirements.md - Overall platform vision and features
2. Phase_1_Scope.md - Current project focus (e-textbook approach)
3. Development_Guide.md - How to approach development

**YOUR TASK:**
Build Phase 1 of this platform focusing on faculty content creation and public content consumption (no student authentication needed). Start with Task 1 (Faculty Authentication) from Tasks/Task_01_Authentication.md.

**IMPORTANT:**
- Choose your own technology stack based on the requirements
- This is an e-textbook platform where faculty create content and anyone can read it publicly
- Build production-ready code with proper error handling and responsive design
- Structure the code to easily add student features in future phases

**START WITH:** Tasks/Task_01_Authentication.md - build the faculty-only authentication system first."

---

## 📋 **ALTERNATIVE SHORTER PROMPT**

If you want a more concise version:

---

**"Build an e-textbook platform where faculty can create courses with hierarchical modules, and anyone can access the content publicly. Read Educational_Platform_Requirements.md and Phase_1_Scope.md for context. Start with faculty authentication from Tasks/Task_01_Authentication.md. Choose appropriate technologies and build production-ready code."**

---

## 📁 **AVAILABLE TASK DOCUMENTS**

Choose which task to work on:

- **Task 1:** `Tasks/Task_01_Authentication.md` - User registration, login, and role-based access
- **Task 2:** `Tasks/Task_02_Course_Creation.md` - Faculty course creation and management  
- **Task 3:** `Tasks/Task_03_Module_System.md` - Hierarchical module creation with unlimited nesting
- **Task 4:** `Tasks/Task_04_Student_Enrollment.md` - Course catalog and student enrollment
- **Task 5:** `Tasks/Task_05_Student_Interface.md` - Student learning and navigation interface
- **Task 6:** `Tasks/Task_06_Analytics.md` - Progress tracking and analytics dashboards

**RECOMMENDED ORDER:** Work through tasks 1-6 sequentially for best results.

## 🎯 **SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS**

**For starting fresh:**
```
"Build an e-textbook platform where faculty can create courses with hierarchical modules, and anyone can access the content publicly. Read Educational_Platform_Requirements.md and Phase_1_Scope.md for context. Start with faculty authentication from Tasks/Task_01_Authentication.md. Choose appropriate technologies and build production-ready code."
```

**For continuing after Task 1:**
```
"I've completed the faculty authentication system. Now build Task 2 (Course Creation) from Tasks/Task_02_Course_Creation.md. Integrate it with the existing authentication so only logged-in faculty can create courses."
```

**For continuing after Task 2:**
```
"Faculty authentication and course creation are working. Now build Task 3 (Module System) from Tasks/Task_03_Module_System.md. Faculty should be able to create hierarchical modules within their courses."
```

## ✅ **WHAT TO EXPECT**

The AI should:
- ✅ Choose appropriate technologies for the requirements
- ✅ Build working, tested code
- ✅ Explain technology choices and architecture decisions  
- ✅ Provide clear setup and deployment instructions
- ✅ Create intuitive user interfaces
- ✅ Handle errors gracefully
- ✅ Build responsive designs

The AI should NOT:
- ❌ Ask you to choose technologies (unless you have preferences)
- ❌ Build incomplete features
- ❌ Skip error handling or validation
- ❌ Create non-responsive interfaces
- ❌ Build without considering user experience

## 📞 **EXAMPLE CONVERSATIONS**

**Starting the project:**
> "Build an Interactive Educational Platform. Start with Task 1 from the provided task documents. Read Educational_Platform_Requirements.md for context and Tasks/Task_01_Authentication.md for specific requirements. Choose appropriate technologies and build a complete authentication system."

**Continuing development:**
> "I've completed the authentication system. Now build Task 2 (Course Creation) from Tasks/Task_02_Course_Creation.md. Integrate it with the existing authentication and ensure only Faculty can create courses."

**Getting help:**
> "I'm having issues with [specific problem] in Task [X]. Can you help debug and fix this issue while maintaining the requirements from the task document?"

**Adding features:**
> "The basic course creation is working. Now add the drag-and-drop module reordering feature from Task 3 (Tasks/Task_03_Module_System.md). Make sure it integrates smoothly with the existing course system."

## 🎯 **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

Your AI-built platform should achieve:
- **Functional:** All specified features work correctly
- **Professional:** Clean, maintainable code with good architecture
- **User-Friendly:** Intuitive interfaces for both faculty and students
- **Complete:** Proper error handling, validation, and edge case coverage
- **Scalable:** Can handle multiple courses, modules, and users
- **Modern:** Responsive design and contemporary user experience

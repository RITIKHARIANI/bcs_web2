# Task 2: Module Creation & Course Assembly System

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Build a system where Faculty can create reusable modules independently, then assemble them into courses. Modules can be used in multiple courses.

## ðŸ“‹ Requirements
- [ ] Independent module creation interface (not tied to specific courses)
- [ ] Module library/management interface for faculty
- [ ] Course creation interface that assembles existing modules
- [ ] Rich media support (images, videos, documents) in modules
- [ ] Module search and filtering in course assembly
- [ ] Module reusability across multiple courses
- [ ] Course editing and module reordering
- [ ] Course status management (draft/published)

## ðŸ‘¤ User Stories
- As a Faculty member, I want to create modules independently of any specific course
- As a Faculty member, I want to add rich content (text, images, videos) to my modules
- As a Faculty member, I want to organize modules into hierarchical structures (modules and submodules)
- As a Faculty member, I want to create courses by selecting and arranging existing modules
- As a Faculty member, I want to reuse the same module in multiple different courses
- As a Faculty member, I want to search through my modules when assembling a course
- As a Faculty member, I want to see which courses are using each of my modules

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Faculty can create modules with rich text, images, videos, and documents
- [ ] Modules exist independently and can be managed in a module library
- [ ] Faculty can create submodules under existing modules (hierarchical structure)
- [ ] Course creation interface shows available modules for selection
- [ ] Faculty can drag-and-drop modules to organize course structure
- [ ] Same module can be added to multiple courses simultaneously
- [ ] Editing a module updates its content across all courses using it
- [ ] Faculty can see usage statistics (which courses use each module)
- [ ] Media uploads work seamlessly within module content editor
- [ ] Course assembly interface is intuitive and responsive

## ðŸ”§ Technical Notes
- Implement many-to-many relationship between modules and courses
- Create separate tables: modules, courses, course_modules (junction table)
- Support rich media uploads with proper file storage (cloud storage recommended)
- Consider module versioning for when modules are updated across multiple courses
- Implement efficient search across module content for course assembly
- Use proper database relationships (Faculty -> Modules, Faculty -> Courses)
- Consider file size limits and storage optimization for media content
- Ensure module deletion checks for course usage before allowing deletion

## âœ¨ Definition of Done
- [ ] Faculty can create standalone modules with rich media content
- [ ] Module library interface allows easy module management
- [ ] Course assembly interface allows selecting and organizing existing modules
- [ ] Module reusability works across multiple courses
- [ ] Media upload and display functionality works correctly
- [ ] Module hierarchy (modules and submodules) functions properly
- [ ] Faculty can see module usage across their courses
- [ ] Interface is responsive and user-friendly for both module creation and course assembly

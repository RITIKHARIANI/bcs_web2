# üéì Professor Handover Guide - BCS E-Textbook Platform

## **Non-Technical Professor Management Analysis**

When handing over to a professor who wants minimal technical involvement, the key factors are:
1. **Ease of content updates** (Can they edit courses without calling IT?)
2. **Maintenance requirements** (Will it break and need fixing?)
3. **Cost predictability** (No surprise bills)
4. **Student experience** (Fast, reliable access)

## üí∞ **Complete Cost Analysis (3-Year TCO)**

### **Course Size Definitions**

#### **Small Course (100-500 students)**
- **Examples**: Single professor's course, specialized graduate seminars, small department offerings
- **Usage Pattern**: 
  - 50-100 concurrent users during peak times
  - 1-5 GB monthly bandwidth
  - 10-50 course modules
  - 100-500 page views per day
- **Typical Scenarios**: 
  - "Introduction to Cognitive Psychology" (1 semester, 150 students)
  - "Advanced Neuroscience Research Methods" (graduate course, 25 students)
  - Small college Brain & Cognitive Sciences program

#### **Medium Course (500-2000 students)**
- **Examples**: Popular undergraduate courses, department-wide requirements, multi-section courses
- **Usage Pattern**:
  - 100-400 concurrent users during peak times
  - 5-20 GB monthly bandwidth  
  - 50-200 course modules
  - 500-2000 page views per day
- **Typical Scenarios**:
  - "General Psychology" (multiple sections, 800 students total)
  - "Brain and Behavior" (required course for psychology majors, 1200 students)
  - Multi-campus course delivery

#### **Large Course (2000+ students)**
- **Examples**: University-wide requirements, online degree programs, MOOC-style courses
- **Usage Pattern**:
  - 400+ concurrent users during peak times
  - 20+ GB monthly bandwidth
  - 200+ course modules
  - 2000+ page views per day
- **Typical Scenarios**:
  - "Introduction to Psychology" (university requirement, 5000 students/year)
  - Online Brain & Cognitive Sciences degree program
  - Multi-university consortium courses

### **üìä Real-World Usage Examples**

#### **Small Course Example: "Cognitive Neuroscience Methods"**
```
Students: 180 per semester
Faculty: 1 professor + 2 TAs
Content: 12 weekly modules, 60 total pages
Peak Usage: Exam weeks (50 concurrent users)
Geographic Spread: Single campus
Cost Impact: Free tier often sufficient, $20/month for reliability
```

#### **Medium Course Example: "Introduction to Brain Sciences"**
```
Students: 1,200 across 4 sections per year  
Faculty: 4 professors + 8 TAs
Content: 50 modules, 300+ pages, video content
Peak Usage: Midterms/finals (300 concurrent users)
Geographic Spread: Multi-campus + online students
Cost Impact: $20-50/month, automatic scaling needed
```

#### **Large Course Example: "Psychology 101 - University Requirement"**
```
Students: 4,500 students per year (1,500 per semester)
Faculty: 12 professors + 20 TAs across multiple campuses
Content: 100+ modules, 800+ pages, multimedia resources
Peak Usage: Registration periods (800+ concurrent users)
Geographic Spread: International students, multiple time zones
Cost Impact: $50-100/month, enterprise features beneficial
```

### **üìà Platform Scaling Behavior**

#### **How Platforms Handle Growth**
```bash
# Vercel/Netlify (Serverless)
Small ‚Üí Medium: Automatic, no configuration changes
Medium ‚Üí Large: Automatic, may need plan upgrade
Cost scaling: Linear with usage

# Docker/AWS (Traditional)  
Small ‚Üí Medium: Manual server upgrades needed
Medium ‚Üí Large: Load balancer setup, multiple servers
Cost scaling: Step function increases (expensive jumps)
```

#### **Traffic Pattern Examples**
```bash
# Small Course Traffic Pattern
Normal day: 20-50 concurrent users
Assignment due: 80-120 concurrent users  
Exam period: 100-150 concurrent users

# Medium Course Traffic Pattern  
Normal day: 100-200 concurrent users
Assignment due: 300-500 concurrent users
Exam period: 600-800 concurrent users

# Large Course Traffic Pattern
Normal day: 400-600 concurrent users
Assignment due: 1000-1500 concurrent users
Exam period: 2000+ concurrent users (potential crashes without auto-scaling)
```

### **üí° Why Course Size Matters for Platform Choice**

#### **Technical Implications**
```bash
# Small Courses
- Can often use free tiers initially
- Simple deployment sufficient  
- Single-region hosting acceptable
- Basic monitoring adequate

# Medium Courses
- Need reliable paid hosting
- Automatic scaling becomes important
- Global CDN provides noticeable benefits
- Analytics become valuable for optimization

# Large Courses  
- Enterprise-grade reliability required
- Must handle traffic spikes gracefully
- Global performance critical for student satisfaction
- Advanced monitoring and alerting essential
```
